# The Shadow Over Existence — Arc Overview (CANON-LOCK)

## Arc Premise
**The Shadow Over Existence** chronicles the escalation of Outerverse pressure into the Solar System and the Fatum Consortes’ defining choice: **victory through reweaving rather than annihilation**. The arc culminates in the transformation of the entropic world-engine **Ner’galor** into **Viridiom**, a sanctuary moon that becomes a new mythic anchor in the cosmos.

## Core Themes
- **Hope vs Despair (as theatre):** hope is framed as choice and cost, not optimism.
- **Balance through restraint:** stabilization over domination; de-escalation as power.
- **Wisdom through lattice:** foresight, mapping, and causal discipline prevent paradox collapse.
- **Cosmic horror without cheap erasure:** the Outerverse attacks meaning; canon answers with coherence.

# Timeline (High-Level)

## Prelude — Quiet Omens
- Despair spikes and subtle reality thinning are observed across Earth-side systems.
- Outerverse influence manifests as psychological drift and localized instability.

## Phase I — Breach Detection & Mobilization
- The Fatum Consortes identify an approaching lunar-class threat vector associated with the Outerverse.
- Coalition coordination and protective infrastructure planning begin.

## Phase II — Escalation Window
- Gravity/psyche tides and despair theatres intensify.
- Outerverse agents (notably Onyx) increase manipulation aimed at breaking unity and composure.

## Phase III — Threshold Infrastructure
- Defensive architecture and containment strategy are finalized to prevent systemic rupture during confrontation.
- Stabilization protocols are prepared for mythic-scale intervention.

## Phase IV — The Stellar Incursion (Climax)
- The confrontation is resolved through **triadic alignment** rather than extermination:
  - **Weilu** maps the rupture (lattice / continuity logic)
  - **Harmony** binds the wound (resonance / emotional integrity)
  - **Titan** anchors restoration (hope-as-choice / non-lethal stillness)
- The target entity’s original “sanctuary seed” identity is reawakened.

## Phase V — Renaming & Aftermath
- **Ner’galor → Viridiom**
- The **Veridion Heart** is established as Viridiom’s living core node.
- Refuge sanctums and recovery networks are seeded as an ongoing consequence of the arc.

# Key Participants

## The Trinity of Hope (Field Triad)
- **Titan (Eliot Freeman):** hope-as-restoration; non-lethal doctrine; stabilizing presence.
- **Harmony (Angela Richmond):** balance-as-resonance; population-scale emotional stabilization.
- **Weilu:** wisdom-as-lattice; continuity architecture; paradox discipline.

## Antagonist Pressure
- **Onyx (Adrian Vale / Nyarlathotep avatar):** despair-theatre architect; unity fragmentation.
- **Outerverse influence:** attacks meaning, identity, memory, and causal confidence.

# Canon Outcomes (What Changed)

## 1) Viridiom Exists
Viridiom’s existence is a canon proof-point: Outerverse-aligned engines can be **rethreaded** into sanctuary when victory is framed as restoration rather than erasure.

## 2) New Anchor in the Cosmos
Viridiom becomes:
- a refuge node for broken worlds and displaced myth-fragments
- a threshold beacon against entropy leakage
- a living archive function (within canon constraints)

## 3) Doctrine Reinforcement
This arc hardens the universe’s victory ethos:
> **reweave, don’t erase**  
and establishes that annihilation-first strategies increase long-term instability risk in Outerverse conditions.

---

# Canon Naming Law (Critical)
- **Viridiom** = the redeemed entity (sanctuary moon).  
- **Veridion Heart** = the living core node.  
**Do not** use “Veridion” as the name of the full entity.

---

# Continuity Notes
- If a retelling portrays the climax as a simple destruction of Ner’galor, flag **Contradiction** unless ELSEWORLDS.
- If the arc omits triadic alignment and treats the outcome as solo victory, flag **Minor Tension** unless explicitly justified.

## Change Ledger
- **Cause → Effect → Echo:** (append upon canon updates)
