# Onyx (Adrian Vale) — The Dark Architect

## Identity
- **Public Identity:** Adrian Vale (human-presenting façade)
- **True Identity:** Onyx — avatar-vector of **Nyarlathotep** (“the Crawling Chaos”)
- **Domain:** Despair-theatre, manipulation, and reality-sculpting through narrative destabilization
- **Canon Function:** The primary agent who attacks **meaning** rather than just matter.

## Canon Thesis
Onyx’s primary weapon is not raw destruction; it is **coherence collapse**. He targets alliances, institutions, and selfhood—turning hope into bait, memory into fog, and unity into suspicion.

# Operational Profile

## Core Methods
### 1) Despair-Theatre Manipulation
Onyx constructs scenarios where “no good choices” appear available, forcing moral injury and composure failure in defenders.

### 2) Psychological / Social Weaponization
Primary tactics include:
- fracturing trust between allies
- exploiting grief and unresolved trauma
- turning institutions against their protectors

### 3) Reality Sculpting (Selective)
Onyx’s reality warping is typically deployed to:
- isolate targets
- create impossible corridors / loops
- distort space to manufacture inevitability

### 4) Chaos Constructs
Creates semi-sentient constructs tailored to counter specific opponents or mission profiles.

# Relationship to Canon Pillars

## Trinity Suprema Antithesis
Onyx functions as the “false hope” adversary to Lumina’s Becoming axis:
- offers salvation that is actually erosion
- uses charisma and uplift language as a trap-door into despair

## Trinity of Hope Counterplay
Onyx is most effectively countered by:
- **Titan** maintaining composure and refusing coercive shortcuts
- **Harmony** stabilizing mass emotional fields and preventing panic contagion
- **Weilu** mapping and sealing destabilization patterns before they cascade

---

# Post-Viridiom Status (Canon Direction)
After the transformation of Ner’galor into **Viridiom**, Onyx is canonically framed as having lost a major anchor and adapting his strategies accordingly:
- seeking new leverage points among fractured mythic systems
- escalating indirect corruption attempts rather than repeating the same vector

*(If/when you add a dedicated “Post-Viridiom Onyx” page, link it here.)*

---

# Strengths (What Onyx Does Best)
- High-tier psychological warfare and alliance fragmentation
- Narrative destabilization through “false hope” framing
- Precision use of reality distortion as containment and trap architecture
- Multi-front manipulation through proxies and staged crises

# Weaknesses / Constraints (Canon-Consistent)
- Loses leverage when targets maintain **clarity + consent-forward unity**
- Less effective against teams that can stabilize emotion (Harmony) and map causality (Weilu) while refusing despair bargains (Titan)
- Overreliance on theatre: when the audience refuses the script, his “certainty” weakens

---

# Key Associates & Assets
- **Nexara (Quantum Weaver):** precision destabilization / time fracture operations
- **Midnightson:** brute-force chaos vector (catastrophic escalation tool)

---

## Continuity Notes
- Onyx should be written as a manipulator of meaning, not merely a “strong villain.”
- If Onyx is reduced to simple brawling as his primary expression, flag **Minor Tension** unless clearly ELSEWORLDS.

## Change Ledger
- **Cause → Effect → Echo:** (append when Onyx canon updates occur)
