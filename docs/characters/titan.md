# Titan (Eliot Freeman)

## Core Identity
- **Alias:** Avatar of Hope  
- **Civilian Identity:** Eliot Freeman  
- **Ethnicity/Nationality:** Nigerian American  
- **Narrative Office:** Mythic Beacon / Narrative Catalyst  
- **Ethos:** Restoration over annihilation; non-lethal first principles.

## Canon Summary
Titan is a myth-aware guardian whose power is governed by ethical restraint. In CANON-LOCK continuity, Titan functions as a stabilizing axis of hope and recovery rather than a weapon of domination.

## Visual Canon
### Baseline (Minimal Iconic)
Use this appearance by default for most scenes, merch, and standard sequential pages.

- **Bodysuit:** smooth **indigo** silhouette; minimal seams  
- **Emblem:** flat, high-contrast **light-teal “T”** centered on chest  
- **Cape:** **salmon hooded cape** with simple collar and drape  
- **Accessories:** none by default (no belts/gauntlets unless story requires)  
- **Eyes:** dark brown; **silver glow only when powered**

### Resonance (Conditional)
Only appears in high-stakes moments (rites, major acts of hope, emotional peaks).

- **Aura:** tri-harmonic atmosphere (gold/green/blue) as a field effect, not costume paint  
- **Emblem shimmer:** subtle star-line shimmer during peak moments; returns to flat immediately after  
- **Sanctigraphy tokens:** used sparingly and only when narratively earned (post-rite residue)

## Power Governance (Canon Locks)
- **Emission Palette:** Hope / Will / Compassion (Love as relational uplift only)  
- **Forbidden:** Fear / Avarice / Rage are not sourced by Titan (telemetry/counter only)

## Signature Capabilities (High-Level)
(Keep precise; do not inflate beyond established canon.)
- **Calmfields / Solar Broadcast Resonance:** large-area stabilization and de-escalation  
- **Cradle of the Fallen Star:** non-lethal isolation / suppression dome under composure constraints  
- **Narrative perception:** identifies symbolic anchors (names, vows, relic-binds) and prioritizes repair over erasure

## Canon Constraints (Brakes)
- Peak techniques require emotional clarity; anger destabilizes outcomes  
- High-tier rites require team alignment (Titan + Harmony + Weilu)  
- Canon cadence/cooldowns apply where defined in governing pages

## Continuity Notes
- Use **Viridiom** for the redeemed entity; **Veridion Heart** for the core node.  
- If depicting post-rite environments, ensure Sanctigraphy grammar is present but restrained.

## Change Ledger
- **Cause → Effect → Echo:** (append when Titan canon updates occur)
