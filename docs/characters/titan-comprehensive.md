# Titan (Eliot Freeman) — Comprehensive Codex

## Identity Snapshot
- **Alias:** Avatar of Hope  
- **Civilian Identity:** Eliot Freeman  
- **Ethnicity/Nationality:** Nigerian American  
- **Role:** Mythic Beacon / Narrative Catalyst  
- **Prime Ethos:** Restoration over annihilation; consent-forward, non-lethal first principles.

## Canon Thesis
Titan is not defined by maximum destruction output, but by **precision, restraint, and myth-aware restoration**. His peak interventions are governed by ethical locks, composure gates, and cadence/cooldowns. In canon, Titan’s role is to **turn collapse into sanctuary**—without erasing cost.

# Abilities & Domains

## 1) Stellar Energy Domain (Primary)
**Functions**
- Absorption and conversion of stellar radiation into usable power output.
- Energy emission for shielding, propulsion, and calibrated force projection.
- Radiation-safe operation (functions as nourishment rather than mutagenic harm in canon framing).

**Common Applications**
- Wide-area shielding
- Precision energy redirection
- Atmospheric and vacuum mobility

---

## 2) Gravitational Domain (Primary)
**Functions**
- Local vector manipulation (lift, immobilize, dampen impacts).
- Structural stabilization (collapse prevention, debris control).
- Containment fields (non-lethal restraint, battlefield isolation).

**Common Applications**
- “Anchor” stabilization during disasters
- Crowd-safe immobilization of threats
- Precision rescue trajectories

---

## 3) Temporal Domain (Secondary / Strategic)
**Functions**
- Localized time-sense and limited timeflow shaping.
- Short-duration stasis corridors for rescue and containment.
- Paradox-resistance framing via “fixed-point” constraint (cannot erase meaningful cost).

**Common Applications**
- Hostage extraction windows
- Emergency sequencing during reality-skew incidents
- Tactical delay fields to prevent escalation

---

## 4) Affective / Calmfield Domain (Primary Support)
**Functions**
- De-escalation aura (“calmfield”) that reduces panic spikes without coercive mind control.
- Population-scale stabilization (“broadcast resonance”) when conditions permit.

**Common Applications**
- Riot collapse prevention
- Trauma-field stabilization
- “Breathing room” effect for communities under despair pressure

---

## 5) Narrative / Mythic Domain (Advanced)
**Functions**
- Perceives symbolic anchors (names, vows, relic-bindings, mythic taboos) as actionable structures.
- Executes restoration via meaning-repair rather than annihilation.
- Produces “memory construct” style interventions: reframing identity wounds to interrupt corruption loops.

**Common Applications**
- Breaking hostile mythic bindings without destroying the bearer
- Restoring agency in corrupted entities (when consent/choice is possible)
- Sealing paradox scars through triadic rites

---

# Signature Techniques (Canonical Set)

## Cradle of the Fallen Star (Non-Lethal Isolation)
A containment technique that creates a localized dome of altered conditions designed to reduce hostile output and induce reflection rather than harm.

**Known Constraints**
- Requires composure (fails or destabilizes if Titan is in rage).
- Timed window constraints apply (canon cadence).

## Solar Broadcast Resonance (Population Stabilization)
A large-area broadcast field used to reduce panic cascades and stabilize collective morale.

**Use Case**
- Planetary-scale crisis response and recovery coordination.

## Legend Reforge / Mythic Disjunction (Narrative Tools)
Narrative-level techniques used to repair or separate corrupted story-anchors, names, and empowering bindings.

**Use Case**
- Countering despair-theatre manipulation
- Restoring truer self-concepts during corruption events

# Strengths (What Titan Does Best)
1) **Non-lethal victory conditions** — Titan is strongest when the win condition is preservation + restraint.  
2) **Disaster-scale rescue** — rapid stabilization of mass casualty events.  
3) **De-escalation leadership** — can reduce panic cascades without coercion.  
4) **Myth-aware repair** — can target symbolic anchors rather than just bodies.  
5) **Triadic synergy** — peak reality-sealing outcomes occur with Harmony + Weilu alignment.

---

# Weaknesses & Brakes (Canonical Limits)
## 1) Frequency Governance (Hard Lock)
- Titan may **emit** only: **Hope / Will / Compassion** (Love as relational uplift).  
- Titan may **not emit**: **Fear / Avarice / Rage** (telemetry/counter only).

## 2) Composure Gate
Many peak techniques require calm clarity. Anger and moral injury reduce reliability.

## 3) Cadence / Cooldowns
Canon-defined windows apply (Cradle timing, Rite cadence, arc-limited pulses where relevant).

## 4) Fixed-Point Causality
Titan cannot “cheap retcon” consequence: cost cannot be erased, only integrated.

## 5) Ethical Locks
Titan will refuse extermination-first solutions when an agency-preserving alternative exists—this can be tactically exploited by adversaries who weaponize civilians, fear, or time pressure.

---

# Key Allies & Mentorship
## Core Allies (Primary)
- **Harmony (Angela Richmond)** — Guardian of Balance; stabilizes emotional fields; triadic rite partner.
- **Weilu** — Strategist Supreme; continuity architect; triadic rite partner.

## Operational Allies (Support)
- **Astra Veloria** — artifact interface and cosmic logistics (when present in arc continuity).
- **Jaden Harper (The Virtuoso)** — resonance support, morale and sonic field utility (if used in current canon scope).

## Mentor Pillars (Trinity Suprema)
- **Lumina** — Hope/Becoming axis (Titan’s cosmic lineage anchor).
- **Gaea** — Life/Continuity axis (restoration and ecological recursion anchor).
- **Harbinger** — Balance/Time axis (fixed-point law and foresight governance).

---

# Adversaries (Primary Threat Set)
## Outerverse Antagonists
- **Onyx (Adrian Vale / Nyarlathotep avatar)** — despair-theatre, manipulation, entropy reversal doctrines.
- **Nexara (Quantum Weaver)** — precision destabilization, time fractures, targeted continuity disruption.
- **The Midnightson** — chaos conduit; storm-scale destruction vectors.

## Threat Notes
Titan’s hardest matchups are opponents who:
- weaponize **Fear/Avarice/Rage** fields faster than calmfields can stabilize,
- force “no good options” dilemmas to strain his ethical locks,
- attack **meaning/identity/continuity** rather than physical durability.

---

# Canon Linkage: Viridiom
Titan’s post-incursion mythic role is bound to the existence of **Viridiom** (redeemed sanctuary entity) and its **Veridion Heart** (core-node). Canon naming must be preserved: **Viridiom ≠ Veridion** (Veridion refers to the core).

---

# Visual & Symbol Map (Quick Reference)
- **Baseline palette:** indigo suit + salmon hooded cape + flat light-teal “T.”
- **Resonance cues:** tri-harmonic aura (gold/green/blue), minimal and atmosphere-bound.
- **Motif:** hope-through-cost; restraint as strength; repair without erasure.
