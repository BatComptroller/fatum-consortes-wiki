# Harmony (Angela Richmond)

## Core Identity
- **Alias:** Harmony  
- **Civilian Identity:** Angela Richmond  
- **Ethnicity/Heritage:** Yoruba and Cherokee descent  
- **Role:** Guardian of Ethereal Balance / Celestial Bridge  
- **Ethos:** Stabilize before striking; heal without coercion; unity through resonance.

## Canon Summary
Harmony is the primary balance axis within the Trinity of Hope. Her power expresses as **resonance, restoration, and social coherence**—a countermeasure to despair cascades and reality corrosion. In CANON-LOCK continuity, Harmony is essential to large-scale healing, treaty-making, and triadic rites that seal dimensional rupture.

# Visual Canon (Baseline vs Avatar State)

## Baseline (Human-Presenting)
- **Height:** 5'6"  
- **Hair:** shoulder-length wavy auburn  
- **Eyes:** warm brown  
- **Signature Relic:** the **Celestial Veil** (cosmic silk garment responsive to lunar/solar cycles)

## Avatar State (Resonance-Triggered)
- Eyes may shift toward **silver-lunar glow** during peak harmonic output.
- Veil reflects real-time balance fluctuations and may intensify constellation motifs.

# Abilities & Domains

## 1) Balance Manipulation (Primary)
Harmony stabilizes imbalances across physical, emotional, and metaphysical systems without requiring domination-first solutions.

## 2) Soul Restoration (Primary)
Heals emotional and spiritual wounds; supports recovery from trauma fields and despair contamination.

## 3) Celestial Awareness (Support)
Detects disturbances across dimensions; senses instability patterns and emergent corruption.

## 4) Energy Projection (Support / Defensive)
Generates shielding fields, calming waves, and containment-grade barriers. Effects commonly manifest as constellation-like light structures.

# Signature Powers (Canonical Set)

## Lunarch Weave
Harmonizes soul-signatures across groups, stabilizing mass emotional imbalance and reducing panic contagion.

## Celestial Soul Song
A resonance technique that disrupts reality corruption and fortifies fragile timelines (especially effective during sealing rites).

## Empathic Dimensional Link
Tethers emotional frequencies between realms for real-time stabilization support and cross-realm coordination.

## Orbital Chord (Planetary-Scale)
A large-scale resonance mode capable of stabilizing mass trauma events and reducing despair-field amplification across populations.

# Relics & Implements

## Celestial Veil
A living garment-artifact tied to celestial cycles and balance sensing. Serves as both a perceptual instrument and a ritual amplifier.

## Moon-Threaded Scepter (If/When Active in Current Arc)
A lunar-channeling implement associated with high-order balance constructs and mass stabilization sequences.

# Strengths (What Harmony Does Best)
- Population-scale stabilization and de-escalation
- Trauma-field healing and soul restoration
- Diplomatic mediation between factions/pantheons
- Triadic rite synergy (with Titan + Weilu)
- Countering despair cascades with non-coercive resonance

# Weaknesses & Brakes (Canon-Consistent)
- Empathic load risk: extended mass trauma stabilization can cause overload without support.
- Lower brute-force output vs dedicated tank archetypes (Harmony’s win condition is stabilization, not devastation).
- Peak effects require emotional integrity and alignment (misalignment reduces efficacy).

---

# Key Allies & Adversaries

## Core Allies (Trinity of Hope)
- **Titan:** hope-as-restoration; non-lethal containment and broadcast stabilization
- **Weilu:** wisdom-as-lattice; paradox discipline and continuity mapping

## Primary Adversarial Pressure
- **Onyx:** targets unity, trust, and emotional stability (“despair-theatre”)
- **Outerverse influence:** attempts to corrupt resonance into instability or nihilistic silence

---

# Canon Linkage: Viridiom
Harmony is canon-linked to the transformation of **Ner’galor → Viridiom**, where resonance and naming work were central to rethreading the entity into sanctuary function.

---

## Continuity Notes
- If Harmony is depicted as domination-first or emotionally indifferent, flag **Minor Tension** unless ELSEWORLDS.
- If Harmony is treated as optional to triadic seals, flag **Contradiction** in CANON-LOCK contexts.

## Change Ledger
- **Cause → Effect → Echo:** (append when Harmony canon updates occur)
