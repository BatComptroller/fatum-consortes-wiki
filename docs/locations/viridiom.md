# Viridiom (formerly Ner’galor)

## Identity
- **Type:** Re-sanctified sanctuary moon / myth-aware soulworld  
- **Former Designation:** Ner’galor (entropic world-eater / Outerverse engine)  
- **Core Node:** **Veridion Heart** (living biomechanical soul-node)  
- **Primary Role:** Refuge and restoration for broken worlds, lost civilizations, and displaced myth-refugees.

## Canon Naming Law
- **Viridiom** = the redeemed entity (the moon/sanctuary world).  
- **Veridion Heart** = the living core node.  
**Do not** use “Veridion” as the name of the whole entity.

## Origin (Post-Stellar Incursion)
Viridiom emerged when Titan, Harmony, and Weilu chose **transformation over annihilation** during the Stellar Incursion. The entity’s prior function (consumption/entropy) was rethreaded into sanctuary function (preservation/restoration).

## Physical & Environmental Features
- **Surface:** verdant crystal plains; psionic bloom forests; relic sanctums grown from obsidian flora  
- **Atmosphere:** region-variable; inner sanctums sustain life; outer shell refracts despair into bioluminescent signal-fields  
- **Expression:** Viridiom “speaks” rarely through dream-pulses, harmonic memory storms, and mirror-moss glyph blooms.

## Consciousness Profile
Viridiom is awake in a listening state rather than domination. Emotional tones commonly recorded:
- solemnity
- sorrow
- awe
- emerging gratitude

## Functions (What Viridiom *does*)
### 1) Refuge & Restoration
Hosts self-contained sanctums for:
- survivors of collapse events
- redeemed adversaries
- displaced cultures and myth-fragments

### 2) Living Archive
Retains soul-records of deaths under despair and preserves “second-becoming” potential (where canon allows).

### 3) Threshold Beacon
Anchors entropy regulation at the Solar System’s edge and supports the protective function of the Threshold Ring network.

## Interaction & Access
- **Visibility Rule:** typically perceived only by beings marked by profound loss or mythic transfiguration.  
- **Visitor Profiles:** healers, redeemed adversaries, cosmic refugees, meta-aware mystics.

## Key Systems / Phenomena
- **Choir of Hollow Echoes:** orbiting sonic temple structures emitting lullaby fields to sedate entropy-beasts and stabilize fragile timelines.  
- **Terraformative Resonance:** can recreate damaged ecosystems using seeded restorative codes (aligned with life/continuity motifs).

## Relationship to the Trinity of Hope
Viridiom is canon-linked to:
- **Titan** (hope-as-restoration)
- **Harmony** (balance-as-resonance)
- **Weilu** (wisdom-as-lattice)

## Blessing Protocol (Reserved)
Viridiom may initiate a gratitude-linked systemic blessing after qualifying compassion acts. (Details should be documented on a dedicated “Viridiom Blessing” page when expanded.)

## Continuity Notes
- Viridiom’s existence is an explicit proof-point of the universe’s victory ethos: **reweave, don’t erase**.
- If an entry implies Viridiom should be destroyed “to be safe,” flag **Contradiction** unless clearly ELSEWORLDS.

## Change Ledger
- **Cause → Effect → Echo:** (append when Viridiom canon updates occur)
