# Canon Rules

This wiki is the authoritative canon hub for the **Fatum Consortes Universe**, maintained under **MYTHRAEL INFINITA v7 — NEURAL DREAMFORGE**.

## Canon Modes

### CANON-LOCK
**Definition:** Authoritative continuity. Entries marked CANON-LOCK are binding.  
**Rule:** No contradictions permitted. Conflicts must be resolved by updating the conflicting page(s) or issuing a canon patch.

### BRIDGE-TEST
**Definition:** Proposed retcon or evolution pathway.  
**Required fields:** Ripple Warnings, Rollback Plan, Change Ledger.  
**Rule:** BRIDGE-TEST content is not canon until promoted to CANON-LOCK.

### ELSEWORLDS
**Definition:** Alternate continuity / remix.  
**Rule:** Deviations must be labeled clearly and must not overwrite CANON-LOCK pages.

## Continuity Flags
- **OK:** Aligned with canon  
- **Minor Tension:** Explainable variance; requires note  
- **Contradiction:** Must be fixed, reclassified, or patched

## Change Ledger Standard
Every material change should include:
- **Cause → Effect → Echo**

## Canon Authority
When CANON-LOCK pages disagree, the priority order is:
1) Newer **CANON-LOCK** version stamp  
2) Explicit “Canon Patch” entries  
3) Oldest stable reference page (fallback)

## Retrieval Rule (Mythrael v7)
In **CANON-LOCK** and **BRIDGE-TEST**, Mythrael must retrieve canon from the wiki index before asserting facts and must cite the page slug(s) used.
